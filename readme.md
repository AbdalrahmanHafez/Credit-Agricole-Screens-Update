# Credit Agricole ATM Screens Upgrade Automation
This project is a Python-based solution designed to streamline the process of updating outdated ATM screens for Credit Agricole Bank. By automating the extraction, positioning, and creation of updated ATM screen designs, the project significantly reduces the time and effort required compared to manual methods.

## Features
* Text Detection with Tesseract OCR: Utilizes Tesseract OCR to analyze the original ATM screen images and detect the text content and its position accurately.
* Photoshop Automation via COM Interface:
* Drastically reduces the time required to process each ATM screen.
